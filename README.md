# Data Engineering Portfolio

I'm currently a data engineer at MuzeData where I leverage a AWS-based tech stack along with Python, AirFlow & SQL to build data pipelines that yield business insights, generate revenue and help optimize costs for internal stakeholders. I'm excited to share my still developing data engineer portfolio. Within this repository, you'll find a comprehensive catalog of projects completed in various data analytics/engineering courses each of which covers essential skills and techniques.
